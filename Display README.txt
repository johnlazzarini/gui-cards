This is a single-file version of my GUI Cards application.  This project was completed as a
part of a software engineering class assignment -- some (albeit very little) of the method
and class code were provided for me, and the rest I developed and wrote myself with some direction.

To get the actual card images to display, you just need to add an "images" file to your project,
to which you should paste the various provided open-source card images as named in the repository.

To run this code, simply paste it into a new project on your preferred IDE.  Enjoy!
