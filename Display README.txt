This is a single-file version of my GUI Cards application.  This project was completed as a
part of a software engineering class assignment -- some (albeit very little) of the method
and class code were provided for me, and the rest I developed and wrote myself with some direction.

To get the actual card images to display, add an "images" file to your project --
the included "images zipped" .zip folder contains all of the images you'll need.  Feel free to download
the screenshot I committed, in case you'd prefer not to try out the code and are instead just interested in
seeing what the output looks like.

To run this code, simply paste it into a new project on your preferred IDE.  Enjoy!
