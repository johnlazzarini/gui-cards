This is a single-file version of my GUI Cards application.  This project was completed as a
part of a software engineering class assignment -- some (albeit very little) of the method
and class code were provided for me, and the rest I developed and wrote myself with some direction.

To get the actual card images to display, add an "images" file to your project.  The included "images zipped" 
.zip folder contains all of the images you'll need to put into the necessary file -- don't worry, they're 
from an open source.   In case you'd prefer not to try out the code and you're just interested in seeing 
what the output looks like, feel free to check out the screenshot I committed.

To run this code, simply paste it into a new project on your preferred IDE.  Enjoy!
